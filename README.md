# AsmodeusRat Rat 

## This is a simple rat for managing multiple sessions with screenshot ability

This project essentially serves as a template for developing rats or c2's without rewriting everything from the ground up.

I made this for fun 



* session management

* scalable

* Automatically imports missing liberties

* shell access


# How to use it :
  * change your host and port in server.py and client.py
  * run server.py
  * when you got a connection type *list* it shows the clients connected to you
  * then type *select <user id>* example : select 0
  * enjoy !
